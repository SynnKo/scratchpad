# What is this?

*Life is short, but ideas are endless.*

I've taken many notes for various ideas over the years, most of which I'll never be able to work on. This repository is a way for me to get these ideas out of my system, figuratively and literally, so they don't just rot away on my hard disk never to be seen by anyone other than me.

This repository is mostly for myself. I'm under no illusion that I have great or even original ideas - most of my ideas are probably trash or have been done in some way before - but I do hope that maybe someday, someone might stumble upon this repository and find at least a little something to be inspired by.

Until that day comes, if at all, I will just keep "mining away" at all my countless plain text files scattered all over my PC whenever I have time - to extract whatever I personally find worthwhile to add to this collection. If some ideas are more fleshed out, I might break them off into their own repositories. These repositories would have "scratchpad-" prepended to their names.
