# What is this?

*Life is short, but ideas are endless.*

I've taken many notes for various ideas over the years, most of which I'll never be able to work on. This repository is a way for me to get these ideas out of my system, figuratively and literally, so they don't just rot away on my hard disk never to be seen by anyone other than me.

This repository is mostly for myself. I'm under no illusion that I have great or even original ideas - most of my ideas are probably trash or have been done in some way before - but I do hope that maybe someday, someone might stumble upon this repository and find at least a little something to be inspired by.

Until that day comes, if at all, I will just keep "mining away" at all my countless plain text files scattered all over my PC whenever I have time - to extract whatever I personally find worthwhile to add to this collection. If some ideas are more fleshed out, I might break them off into their own repositories. These repositories would have "scratchpad-" prepended to their names.

# Email Chain to File Converter

Most email clients and services like Outlook and Gmail offer the option to download individual emails in the form of .eml files. These .eml files contain the original email, including the sender, recipients, attachments, etc. To view .eml files, you need an email client, like Outlook.

While this is fine for most people and most situations, I personally would like to have the option to export entire email chains this way, keeping the relations between the initial email, the response emails, and the forwarded emails intact, in a form that is independent of email clients.

The Email Chain to File Converter would do just that. It would turn an email chain into a single HTML file, which displays all emails in a hierarchical manner, with the option to open or collapse specific emails. The various attachments would be saved in a companion folder, much like what you get when you "Save as..." a website on most browsers.

While the most convenient way to use such a tool would be as an extension in any of the popular email clients, probably the most realizable way to create such a tool would be as a local app, which would stitch the .eml files you get from places like Outlook and Gmail together. However, I don't know if the .eml files themselves actually hold this email chain information.
